amrFORTH was designed around Gforth.

Gforth 0.5.0 or thereabouts was used until near versions 4, 5, or 6;
(don't have that information on-hand at the time of this writing).

amrFORTH v7 definitely had the newer Gforth (near 0.6.0, perhaps?)

Gforth 0.6.x was the one used with the newest version(s) of amrFORTH.

Where newer Gforth was unavailable, reversion to an earlier variant
of amrFORTH was one way to work around this limit.  In that case,
Gforth 0.5.0 (or similar) was used.

It's possible the main difference was in the handling of the 
hardware serial ports on the host PC running Linux.  amrFORTH
was built around machines that had DB-9 (9-pin) serial ports
that used RS-232 to communicate with the AMR stamp motherboard
(via a pair of RJ-45 jacks).
