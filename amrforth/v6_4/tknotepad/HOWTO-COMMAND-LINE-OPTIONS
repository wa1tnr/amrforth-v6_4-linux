This file describes the use of the command line options.

Th efollowing optinos are allowed:

	-f  	for a new window can be given no argument or a file name
	-nf 	create a new file, this sets the title to the new file name requires a 
		file name as an argument     	  
	-fg  	set the foreground color 
		should be the first options used if they are used.
	-bg	set the background color 
		should be the first options used if they are used.
	-p 	input data from a pipe, this requires an incoming pipe |
		if used it shoudl be the last option on the command line

See examples below:

	The order of the command line switches is important when mixed together.
	If the -f and -p are used together it is possible to fork a new tknotepad 
	with the output of the pipe. The below line will do this

	cat /proc/cpuinfo | tknotepad -f -p                

	here are some examples of the options and there usage

	cat /proc/cpuinfo | tknotepad -bg yellow -fg magenta -f tknotepad -p
	cat /proc/cpuinfo | tknotepad -p
	cat /proc/cpuinfo | tknotepad -bg yellow -fg magenta -bg yellow -p      
	tknotepad -bg yellow -fg magenta -f -f tknotepad
	tknotepad -f
	tknotepad -nf newfilename

 	or to use them all and pipe the output of a file or process into a new file and 
	open another file at the same time try

 	cat /proc/cpuinfo | tknotepad -bg yellow -fg magenta -f tknotepad -p -nf cpuinfo 
	cat /proc/cpuinfo | tknotepad -f tknotepad -p -nf cpuinfo 

	or just create a new file from the output of a pipe

	cat /proc/cpuinfo | tknotepad -p -nf cpuinfo
