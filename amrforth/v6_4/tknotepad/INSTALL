This file describes how to install tknotepad under windows 95/98 and under Linux:

It is assumed that Tcl 8.0 and tk8.0 or greater have been already installed on your system. These 
libraries are failry standard on most linux distributions (Slackware 3.4 or later RH5.0 or later).
   
You can obtain the Tcl/Tk libraries from http://www.scriptics.com . As of the time of this writing they 
are free.

Read the installation of Tcl/Tk for your operating system, as that is beyond the scope of this 
document.

Line numbering:
---------------

patch name = linenum.pth

As of version 0.6.9 a special added patch is included for those who want line numbering.
This is a 'bonus' or 'addition' that I have no intention of making part of the standard 
distribution so deal with it :-). It is a port of code in one of my other editors.
It simple adds an entry to the bottom of the window, and puts the line number and column 
number in the widget. To use this code simply add it to the end of the tknotepad script.
The code is not perfect yet, as it makes the text widget a little wider, but it does not 
add to much overhead to the program.

Eventually I may have scripts for adding this code both for Windows and *NIX but for now if
you want this feature it must be added manually.

Goto to Line nunmber:
---------------------

patch name gotoline.pth

As of version 0.7.0 there has been added a patch that will add a goto line number menu option 
to the search menu. If this is to be applied with the line numbering patch it shoudl be added 
after the line numbering patch so that when you goto a line it will display the correct line
number. If this is going to be added without the line number patch then it just gets added to 
the end of the tknotepad script.

A popup menu:
-------------

patchname = popup.pth

This patch is now completed but not working the way I expected. It is bound to both Button 2 
and Button 3, and should be just Button 2. This is a tcl/tk X Windows issue thou.
It shows the Edit popup menu however, and works for me so I am happy with it.

New window:
---------------

patch name = newwin.pth

This patch adds a menu item to the File menu that will launch a new menu.
This patch may not work on Windows or Mac.

INSTALLING:

On Linux

Installing the tarball under Linux (this should work for other UNIXes also but has not been tested)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) gunzip and untar the file I use the following command 

# tar -zxvf tknotepad-0.7.0.tar.gz 
	
2) cd to the tknotepad-0.7.0 directory and make sure the permissons are set to 755, 
then copy tknotepad to /usr/local/bin/ or somewhere else that is in your path. 

#chmod 755 tknotepad
#cp tknotepad /usr/local/bin/

NOTE: You will need root access to copy to /usr/local/bin, if you do not have root 
access you can put in your home directory, and run it from there. 

3) Make a symbolic link from your version of wish (i.e. wish8.0) to wish. You can do so with the 
following command:

	ln -s wish8.0 wish	
	
NOTE: You will need root access to do this. The other option is to change the first line in the 
tknotepad script FROM: 

	#!/usr/local/bin/wish -f

TO:

	#!/usr/local/bin/wish8.0 -f

this is assuming that you have version 8.0 of wish, if you have another version then instead of  
wish8.0 put wishx.x where x.x is the version number of Tk that you have.

4) To run make sure you are running X-windows then in an xterm type tknotepad &

Installing Under Windows 95 (this should work for NT and 98 also but has not been tested)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Winzip should have been used to extract this and it should have created a directory. This program now comes 
with a batch script to run under Windows 95/98/NT, called tknote.bat. The batch script has one line, shown below.

	C:\Progra~1\Tcl\bin\wish80 tknotepad

Edit the path to point to the location of your version of wish (in this case wish8.0). Then run the script. 
tknote.bat startup script.
