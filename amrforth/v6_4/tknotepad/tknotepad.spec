%description
This is a simple text editor. I have tried to incorporate most of the same features as Window Notepad, with a few added features. I have added unlimited Undo/Redo, thank to the borrowed code. It now accepts pipes (UNIX only) and can open multiple files from the command line.  I have also refined the code a bit, and thanks to many others for there bug reports. Thank you , Joseph Acosta.
