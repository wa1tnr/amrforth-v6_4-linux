This file describes the 'bugs' or issues that are know in tknotepad as of 10/17/99.
These are issues that I have found in Tcl/Tk. This is the behavior that they supply,
and I am not even sure if it can be overridden.

Please report all bugs to joeja@mindspring.com

KNOWN ISSUES: 	

	1) ) If you have 2 tknotepads running, and are cutting or coping between them
	the selection will get lost after coping text in tknotepad then closed  that
	tknotpad before pasting the text. This happens in other programs too. It
	is an Tcl/Tk selection thing. Netscape has this bug, nedit has this bug. Once the 
	program is closed, its selection is lost. This I believe is a legacy Motif
	behavior. IE setting the clipboard and then deleteing the contents when the 
	app is destroyed. This happens under windows also. This wont be fixed unless it 
	is fixed in the tcl/tk code.

	2) WORD WRAP only wraps the text in the widget, but it does not create 
	'end of line' marks. It is more of a 'visual change' ONLY. vi does the same
	thing. This wont be fixed, unless it is fixed in the base tcl/tk code.

	3) Windows: The menuFont for windows is Sans Serif 8. This is the default, and 
	the -font option of Tcl/Tk does not work to set this for windows menu bar but 
	the sub menues will take the -font option. I have reported this to scriptics.
	It is a tcl/tk / window issue.

	4) The popup menu is bound to buttons 2 and 3 this is because on some systems 
	there is 3 button emulation, so the second button is actually the 3rd. Thus 
	both the 2nd and 3rd buttons are bound to th epopup for platform and system
	compatability. I hope this works for all.


let me know what bugs you find or fix...........
