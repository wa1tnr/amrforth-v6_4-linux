the UNDO / REDO was taked from X-WordPad?

and I lost the license file and cannot locate the license to it.

I have since slightly modified the Undo/ Redo code to suite my needs.


The find / Replace code was taken from another editor and have since 
been refined and modifed to work as I want them to.

The license for thse programs allowed modification and use, but both I think
wanted the licences included from them.

Unfortuanetly I lost them somehow.

My current feeling are this is now your code so do as you wish!
